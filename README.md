WeThinkCode Java Project

Project consists of three parts: router, brokers and markets.

Run make.sh to precompile the project. 
First, run router.sh to start a new instance of the router. 
Next, run broker.sh and market.sh to start new instances of the clients. 

Requires Maven to be installed.

Type "exit" to terminate the router and market instances.
Choose option 3 to terminate the broker instances.

Orders and market responses are generated at random. The programs' feedback serves only to demonstrate networked communication and is not indicative of underlying systems.
